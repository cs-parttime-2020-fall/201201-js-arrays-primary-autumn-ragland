# 20 12 01 JS Arrays Primary

Complete exercises 1 - 3 in order then attempt the bonuses. Add comments above each exercise solution (at minium). For ease of grading/completion all outputs should be in the console, not in alerts. Comment out any broken code before 9PM submission and provide context on what's not working.

### Exercise 1 
Declare an array of famous authors with the following authors : Agatha Christie, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, Octavia E. Butler, Maya Angelou, and Mary Shelly. Output the array to the console. Output the length of the array in the formatted message : "There are currently [NUMBER_OF_AUTHORS] authors in the list of famous authors."

### Exercise 2 
Prompt the user for an index position. Output the formatted message : "The author at index position [USER_INDEX_ENTERED] is [AUTHOR_AT_POSITION]" if the index position returns an element. Otherwise output the formatted message : "[USER_ENTERED_INDEX] is out of range".

### Exercise 3
Prompt the user for an author name to determine the index position. Look up the author using indexOf. Output the formatted message : "[USER_AUTHOR_ENTERED] is at index position [INDEX_POSITION]" if the element returns an index position. Otherwise add the author to the end of the array, output the formatted message : "[USER_AUTHOR_ENTERED] is not in the famous author array. [USER_AUTHOR_ENTERED] has been added at index position [INDEX_POSITION]", and output the updated array to the console.

### Bonus 1
Add Audre Lorde to the beginning of the array. Output the message "Added Audre Lorde" and the updated array in the console.

### Bonus 2
Replace Agatha Christie with Alice Walker by redefining the element at that index position. Output the message "Replaced Agatha Christie" and the updated array in the console.

### Bonus 3
Remove Sylvia Plath from the array using splice without hard coding the start. Output the message "Removed Sylvia Plath" and the updated array in the console.
